================================================================================
1. NOTION PAGE LAYOUT REVIEW
   (Source: src/notion_service.py, _build_review_blocks method, lines 442-529)
================================================================================

1.1 INFORMATION HIERARCHY ASSESSMENT
-------------------------------------
Current section order:
  [1] Divider + "문제 정보" (Problem Info callout)
  [2] Divider + "문제 이미지" (Problem Image)
  [3] Divider + "출제 의도" (Intent)
  [4] Divider + Hints (3 toggleable headings)
  [5] Divider + "풀이" (Solution toggle)
  [6] Divider + "검수 체크리스트" (Review Checklist)

Evaluation:
  GOOD - The hierarchy starts with identification metadata (subject, unit,
  score, answer type, answer), which gives the reviewer immediate context.
  Placing the problem image second is correct -- reviewers need to see the
  source material before evaluating the generated content below it.

  ISSUE - The "정답" (answer) is buried inside the info callout alongside
  metadata. For a review workflow, the answer is one of the most critical
  verification items. It would be more effective to visually separate the
  answer from the static metadata, perhaps with bold formatting or its own
  callout block to draw the reviewer's eye.

  ISSUE - The "출제 의도" (intent) section is placed before hints and
  solution. While this makes logical sense from a content-authoring
  perspective, from a reviewer's task flow, the reviewer typically checks
  (1) image correctness, (2) answer correctness, (3) solution accuracy,
  and (4) hint quality. The intent is supplementary context. Consider
  moving "출제 의도" after "풀이" (solution) or collapsing it into a toggle.

  SUGGESTION - Recommended section order for optimal review flow:
    [1] 문제 정보 (metadata callout)
    [2] 문제 이미지 (problem image)
    [3] 풀이 (solution toggle) -- moved up, since solution verification
        is a higher-priority task than reading intent
    [4] 힌트 1/2/3 (hint toggles)
    [5] 출제 의도 (intent) -- moved down or made toggleable
    [6] 검수 체크리스트 (review checklist)


1.2 VISUAL STRUCTURE & SCANNABILITY
-------------------------------------
  GOOD - Consistent use of dividers between every section creates clear
  visual separation. Heading 2 (heading_2) is used uniformly, giving a
  clean, predictable rhythm.

  GOOD - The callout block for "문제 정보" uses a single consolidated text
  block with line breaks, which keeps metadata compact. This is better
  than using separate blocks for each field.

  ISSUE - There are 6 dividers total across 6 sections. In Notion, this
  many horizontal rules can feel visually heavy, especially on smaller
  screens. Consider removing the first divider (line 447, before "문제
  정보") since it is the opening section and needs no top separator. Also
  consider removing the divider before the checklist, using a callout's
  built-in visual boundary instead.

  ISSUE - The "(이미지 없음 - 업로드 필요)" and "(힌트 미입력)" placeholder
  texts are plain paragraphs. They are easy to miss. Consider using a
  callout with a warning emoji (e.g., "⚠️") and yellow_background color
  to draw attention to missing data that blocks review completion.


1.3 EMOJI/ICON CONSISTENCY
----------------------------
Current emoji mapping:
  - 📋 = Problem info callout
  - 💡 = Hint Stage 1 (Concept Direction) + default callout
  - 🔑 = Hint Stage 2 (Key Transformation)
  - 🎯 = Hint Stage 3 (Decisive Line)
  - ✅ = Review checklist callout

Evaluation:
  GOOD - The hint emoji progression (💡 -> 🔑 -> 🎯) is semantically
  coherent and visually distinct. It tells a story: lightbulb idea ->
  key insight -> target answer. This is a strong design choice.

  GOOD - Color-coded callout backgrounds for hints (blue -> yellow -> red)
  create a natural visual escalation that mirrors hint intensity.

  MINOR ISSUE - The "풀이" (solution) toggle heading has no emoji. For
  consistency, consider adding one (e.g., "📝 풀이" or "🧮 풀이").

  MINOR ISSUE - The "문제 이미지" and "출제 의도" headings also have no
  emoji. For full visual consistency, either add emojis to all section
  headings or remove them from all. Mixed usage creates subtle
  inconsistency, though the current state is acceptable.


1.4 TOGGLE PATTERN EVALUATION
-------------------------------
  GOOD - Hints are collapsed by default (toggleable heading_2). This is
  the correct pattern for review. Reviewers should first try to evaluate
  whether hints are needed and at what level before seeing the actual
  content. Collapsed toggles prevent accidental spoiling of hint content.

  GOOD - Solution is also collapsed by default. This encourages reviewers
  to first check the answer independently before reading the solution.

  SUGGESTION - Consider making "출제 의도" also toggleable. It is not
  critical for the review verification steps and can be checked last.


1.5 REVIEW CHECKLIST EVALUATION
---------------------------------
Current checklist items:
  [1] 문제 이미지 확인 (Check problem image)
  [2] 정답 확인 (Check answer)
  [3] 풀이 정확성 확인 (Check solution accuracy)
  [4] 힌트 3단계 확인 (Check 3-stage hints)
  [5] 과목/단원 분류 확인 (Check subject/unit classification)

Evaluation:
  GOOD - Five items is a reasonable length. Too many checklist items
  would discourage completion; too few would miss critical checks.

  MISSING ITEMS - Based on the database schema and the full data model,
  the following important verifications are absent:

  (a) "배점 확인" (Score verification) -- The schema has both `score`
      (auto-extracted) and `score_verified` (reviewed). The checklist
      should prompt reviewers to verify the score.

  (b) "정답 유형 확인 (객관식/주관식)" (Answer type verification) --
      The auto-extracted answer_type may be wrong. This should be checked.

  (c) "출제의도 확인" (Intent verification) -- Currently not in the
      checklist even though it is a section on the page.

  (d) "난이도 설정" (Difficulty assignment) -- The schema has a
      `difficulty` field (1-5) that is set by reviewers. There is no
      prompt for reviewers to set it, and no property in Notion to
      capture it.

  RECOMMENDED CHECKLIST (8 items):
    [ ] 문제 이미지 확인
    [ ] 정답 확인
    [ ] 배점 확인
    [ ] 정답 유형(객관식/주관식) 확인
    [ ] 풀이 정확성 확인
    [ ] 힌트 3단계 확인
    [ ] 과목/단원 분류 확인
    [ ] 난이도 설정 (1~5)


================================================================================
2. NOTION DATABASE PROPERTY REVIEW
   (Source: src/notion_service.py, create_review_page method, lines 300-375)
================================================================================

2.1 CURRENT PROPERTIES (16 total)
-----------------------------------
  과목, 단원, 문제 ID, 문항번호, 배점, 상태, 시험, 연도,
  원본링크, 이미지폴더, 정답, 출제의도, 풀이, 힌트1, 힌트2, 힌트3

Evaluation:
  ISSUE - 16 properties is at the upper boundary of usability for a Notion
  table view. Notion tables start to feel cramped at 10+ visible columns.
  Many of these properties serve different purposes and not all need to be
  visible simultaneously.

  CATEGORIZATION:
    Core Identification (always visible):
      - 문제 ID (title), 연도, 시험, 문항번호
    Review Status (always visible):
      - 상태
    Scoring Info (visible during review):
      - 배점, 정답
    Classification (visible during review):
      - 과목, 단원
    Content (hide in table, view on page):
      - 출제의도, 풀이, 힌트1, 힌트2, 힌트3
    Links (hide in table, view on page):
      - 원본링크, 이미지폴더


2.2 RECOMMENDED DEFAULT TABLE VIEW
-------------------------------------
  Visible columns (7):
    문제 ID | 연도 | 시험 | 문항번호 | 배점 | 상태 | 정답

  Hidden columns (9):
    과목, 단원, 출제의도, 풀이, 힌트1, 힌트2, 힌트3, 원본링크, 이미지폴더

  REASON: The 7 visible columns provide enough information for a reviewer
  to (a) identify the problem, (b) see its current status, and (c) know
  the answer at a glance. Detailed content (hints, solution, intent) is
  best viewed by opening the page, where the rich content layout is
  designed for review.


2.3 RECOMMENDED ADDITIONAL VIEWS
-----------------------------------
  (a) "검수 필요" (Needs Review) - Board View
      Group by: 상태
      Sort by: 연도 desc, 문항번호 asc
      Purpose: Quick visual overview of review pipeline

  (b) "연도별" (By Year) - Table View
      Group by: 연도
      Filter: 상태 != 발송 준비
      Purpose: Year-by-year progress tracking

  (c) "과목별" (By Subject) - Board View
      Group by: 과목
      Purpose: Subject distribution analysis after review


2.4 MISSING PROPERTIES - RECOMMENDED ADDITIONS
-------------------------------------------------
  (a) "난이도" (Difficulty) - Number property
      PRIORITY: HIGH
      The database schema has a `difficulty` field (1-5) set by reviewers.
      But there is no corresponding Notion property. This means reviewers
      cannot set difficulty during the Notion review workflow. When
      sync_to_supabase runs, it cannot sync difficulty back.
      The supabase_service.py update_problem_from_notion method (line 211)
      already checks for notion_data.get("난이도"), but the property is
      never created in Notion.

  (b) "정답유형" (Answer Type) - Select property
      PRIORITY: MEDIUM
      Options: 객관식, 주관식
      The database has `answer_type` with values 'multiple' or not. The
      Notion page body shows this as "유형: 객관식/주관식" in the info
      callout, but it is not a database property, so it cannot be
      filtered or edited from the table view.

  (c) "검수자" (Reviewer) - Person property
      PRIORITY: LOW
      If multiple people review problems, tracking who reviewed what
      would be valuable for accountability and workload distribution.

  (d) "검수일" (Review Date) - Date property
      PRIORITY: LOW
      Useful for tracking review throughput and identifying stale items.

3. WORKFLOW UX REVIEW
   (Source: sync_to_notion.py)
================================================================================

3.1 CLI INTERFACE ASSESSMENT
------------------------------
  Usage patterns:
    python sync_to_notion.py                              # All problems
    python sync_to_notion.py --year 2026                  # By year
    python sync_to_notion.py --problem-id 2026_CSAT_Q01   # Single problem
    python sync_to_notion.py --dry-run                    # Preview

  GOOD - The CLI interface is clean and follows standard argparse
  conventions. The four flags cover the most common use cases.

  GOOD - The --dry-run flag is a critical safety feature. It shows a
  clear summary table before committing to API calls.

  GOOD - The progress indicator "[1/30] 2026_CSAT_Q01 -> OK (abc12345...)"
  gives real-time feedback during sync.

  GOOD - The statistics summary at the start ("풀이 있음: X, 힌트 3단계: X,
  이미지 있음: X") helps the operator understand data completeness before
  syncing.

  ISSUE - No --status filter. The sync script always processes all
  problems matching the year/exam filter, regardless of their Supabase
  status. If problems are already "ready" in Supabase, re-syncing them
  to Notion (where they would be set to "검수 필요") could regress their
  status. Consider adding --status flag to target only needs_review
  problems.

  ISSUE - No confirmation prompt before full sync. Running
  "python sync_to_notion.py" with no arguments syncs ALL problems (up to
  200). There should be a confirmation prompt: "200개 문제를 동기화합니다.
  계속하시겠습니까? (y/N)" unless --yes flag is passed.

  ISSUE - The 1.5-second sleep between API calls (line 103) is
  appropriate for Notion rate limits, but the total time for 200 problems
  would be 5+ minutes. There is no ETA or estimated time display.

  SUGGESTION - Add --subject filter (Math1/Math2) for targeted syncs.


3.2 STATUS FLOW EVALUATION
-----------------------------
  Current flow:
    검수 필요 (Needs Review) -> 검수 완료 (Review Complete) -> 발송 준비 (Ready to Send)

  The transitions:
    - sync_to_notion.py: Creates page with "검수 필요"
    - Manual: Reviewer changes status to "검수 완료" in Notion
    - sync_to_supabase: Picks up "검수 완료" and changes to "발송 준비"

  GOOD - Three-state flow is clean and easy to understand.

  ISSUE - There is no "수정 필요" (Needs Revision) or "보류" (Hold) status
  available in Notion. The Supabase schema supports 'hold' and 'inactive',
  but the Notion select options only appear to be: 검수 필요, 검수 완료,
  발송 준비. If a reviewer finds a problem that has errors in the AI-
  generated content but cannot fix them, there is no way to flag it as
  blocked. They can only leave it as "검수 필요", which does not
  distinguish "not yet reviewed" from "reviewed and found issues."

  RECOMMENDATION: Add these Notion status options:
    - "수정 필요" (Needs Revision) -- reviewed, has issues
    - "보류" (On Hold) -- deliberately paused

  This gives reviewers 5 status options:
    검수 필요 -> 수정 필요 (if issues found)
    검수 필요 -> 검수 완료 (if approved)
    검수 완료 -> 발송 준비 (automatic via sync)
    Any -> 보류 (manual hold)


3.3 NOTION-TO-SUPABASE REVERSE SYNC
--------------------------------------
  (Source: notion_service.py, sync_to_supabase method, lines 607-636)

  ISSUE - The reverse sync (Notion -> Supabase) only picks up problems
  with status "검수 완료". But reviewers may have edited properties like
  과목, 단원, 정답, 출제의도 directly in Notion. These edits are only
  synced when the status reaches "검수 완료". If a reviewer partially
  reviews (edits some fields but does not change status), those changes
  are lost if someone re-runs sync_to_notion.py (which overwrites the
  page).

  RECOMMENDATION: Before overwriting a Notion page, check if the existing
  page has been modified (e.g., compare updated_at timestamps). Warn
  the operator if reviewer edits would be overwritten.


================================================================================
4. ADMIN PAGE ALIGNMENT REVIEW
   (Source: server/problem_routes.py, /problem/admin endpoint)
================================================================================

4.1 ADMIN PAGE OVERVIEW
--------------------------
  The web admin page at /problem/admin provides:
    - Statistics dashboard (total, ready, needs_review, sent)
    - Filter bar (search, year, exam, score, status)
    - Problem table with Send and Crop actions
    - PDF upload modal (single + batch)
    - Send preview modal with KakaoTalk confirmation

  This page focuses on the SEND workflow (problem -> KakaoTalk).


4.2 ALIGNMENT WITH NOTION REVIEW SYSTEM
------------------------------------------
  ISSUE - The admin page and the Notion review system are disconnected.
  There is no link or reference from the admin page to the Notion review
  status of a problem. The admin page shows Supabase's `status` field
  (needs_review, ready, sent) but does not show whether the problem has
  a Notion page, what the Notion review status is, or provide a link to
  open the Notion review page.

  RECOMMENDATION: Add a "Notion" column to the admin table that shows:
    - An icon/badge indicating Notion sync status
    - A clickable link to open the Notion review page directly
    - The notion_page_id is already stored in Supabase, so constructing
      the URL (https://notion.so/{page_id}) is straightforward

  ISSUE - The admin page uses English column headers (Problem ID, Year,
  Exam, No., Status, Actions) but the Notion database uses Korean
  property names (문제 ID, 연도, 시험, 문항번호, 상태). This language
  inconsistency can confuse operators switching between the two
  interfaces.

  RECOMMENDATION: Either standardize on Korean for both interfaces
  (recommended, since the target audience is Korean), or provide a
  language toggle.

  ISSUE - The admin page filter labels use a mix of Korean and English.
  "검색" (search), "연도" (year), "시험" (exam), "배점" (score), "상태"
  (status) are in Korean, but button text mixes languages: "Send",
  "Crop", "새로고침" (refresh). Standardize to Korean: "발송", "크롭".

  ISSUE - The admin page has a "난이도" label on the score filter dropdown
  (filter-difficulty, line 304-307), but the values are 2/3/4점 (scores),
  not difficulty levels 1-5. This conflates "배점" (score/points) with
  "난이도" (difficulty level). The filter should be labeled "배점" to
  match the Notion property name and avoid confusion.


4.3 ADMIN PAGE UX ISSUES (INDEPENDENT OF NOTION)
---------------------------------------------------
  (a) The problem table only shows 7 columns: checkbox, Problem ID, Year,
      Exam, No., Status, Actions. It does not show score, answer, subject,
      or unit. For quick review triage, showing score and answer in the
      table would help operators decide which problems to prioritize.

  (b) The Send action has a preview modal (good!), but the Crop action
      opens a React component with no preview of the current crop state.
      There is no thumbnail in the table to show which problems have
      images and which do not.

  (c) No pagination. The table loads up to 100 problems. For larger
      datasets this will be slow and unwieldy. Consider pagination or
      virtual scrolling.

  (d) The "PDF 일괄 업로드" (batch PDF upload) feature is excellent for
      onboarding new exam years, but there is no progress indicator
      showing which specific questions have been extracted during
      processing.


================================================================================
5. OVERALL SYSTEM COHESION
================================================================================

5.1 DATA FLOW SUMMARY
------------------------
  Supabase (source of truth) -> sync_to_notion.py -> Notion (review UI)
  Notion (reviewed) -> sync_to_supabase method -> Supabase (updated)
  Supabase (ready) -> Admin page -> KakaoTalk (delivery)

  This three-stage pipeline is architecturally sound. Each system plays
  to its strengths: Supabase for structured data, Notion for human-
  friendly review, Admin page for operational actions.


5.2 KEY GAPS IN THE FLOW
---------------------------
  (a) NO BIDIRECTIONAL SYNC AUTOMATION: The Notion -> Supabase sync
      must be manually triggered. Consider a scheduled job or webhook
      to automate this.

  (b) NO NOTIFICATION ON REVIEW COMPLETION: When a reviewer marks a
      problem as "검수 완료" in Notion, there is no automated notification
      to the operator that problems are ready for Supabase sync. Consider
      integrating Notion webhook or polling.

  (c) NO REVIEW PROGRESS DASHBOARD: Neither the Notion database views
      nor the admin page provide an aggregate view of review progress
      (e.g., "45/60 problems reviewed for 2026 CSAT"). The admin page
      has total counts but not per-year or per-exam breakdowns that
      would show review completion percentage.

  (d) HINT EDITING FRICTION: Hints are stored in a separate `hints`
      table in Supabase and displayed as Notion page body content (in
      toggles). But they are also stored as Notion properties (힌트1,
      힌트2, 힌트3). If a reviewer edits a hint in the property field
      vs. the page body toggle, it is unclear which takes precedence
      during reverse sync. The sync_to_supabase method reads from
      properties, not from page body blocks. This should be documented
      or the page body hints should be read-only.


5.3 REVIEWER EXPERIENCE END-TO-END
-------------------------------------
  Current reviewer workflow:
    1. Open Notion database
    2. Filter by 상태 = "검수 필요"
    3. Open a problem page
    4. Check image (scroll down past info callout)
    5. Verify answer (scroll back up to info callout or check property)
    6. Open solution toggle, verify
    7. Open hint toggles, verify each
    8. Check the 5 to-do items
    9. Manually change 상태 property to "검수 완료"
    10. Move to next problem

  FRICTION POINTS:
    - Step 4-5: Scrolling up and down between image and answer info
    - Step 9: Must change property manually (no button or shortcut)
    - No visual indicator of completion progress within a review session
    - No "next problem" navigation from within the page


================================================================================
6. PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS SUMMARY
================================================================================

  HIGH PRIORITY (should do before next review cycle):
  -------------------------------------------------------
  [H1] Add "난이도" (Difficulty) Notion property (number, 1-5)
       Impact: Enables difficulty tagging, which the DB schema already
       supports and the Supabase sync already reads.

  [H2] Add "수정 필요" and "보류" status options in Notion
       Impact: Gives reviewers a way to flag problematic items.

  [H3] Add confirmation prompt to sync_to_notion.py for full sync
       Impact: Prevents accidental mass-sync that could overwrite
       reviewer edits.

  [H4] Expand review checklist from 5 to 8 items (add 배점, 정답유형,
       출제의도, 난이도)
       Impact: Ensures no review step is missed.

  MEDIUM PRIORITY (improve review quality and speed):
  -------------------------------------------------------
  [M1] Make missing data placeholders more visible (warning callouts
       with ⚠️ emoji instead of plain text)
       Impact: Reviewers immediately spot incomplete data.

  [M2] Add Notion page link column to admin table
       Impact: Seamless transition between admin operations and Notion
       review without manual URL navigation.

  [M3] Add "정답유형" (Answer Type) Notion property (select)
       Impact: Filterable, editable from table view.

  [M4] Reorder sections: move "풀이" before hints, move "출제 의도"
       to toggleable position after hints
       Impact: Better matches the natural review verification order.

  [M5] Standardize admin page labels to Korean
       Impact: Consistent language across Notion and admin interfaces.

  LOW PRIORITY (nice-to-have improvements):
  -------------------------------------------------------
  [L1] Add --status filter to sync_to_notion.py
  [L2] Add ETA display during sync
  [L3] Add "검수자" and "검수일" Notion properties
  [L4] Add review progress dashboard (% complete per year/exam)
  [L5] Reduce divider count in Notion page (remove first and last)
  [L6] Add emoji to "풀이" toggle heading for visual consistency
  [L7] Add image thumbnail column to admin page table
